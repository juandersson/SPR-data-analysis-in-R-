# SPR-data-analysis-in-R-
# Description 
This repository provides curve fitting routines for SPR data analysis in R. It was developed and used for my Bachelor’s thesis. The repository contains a set of R scripts as well as simulated data. 

# Usage 
Note: The R scripts contain code that is set up to model simulated data (available in the “Simulated data” folder) and should be specified to the data being analysed.  

  •	The R script “Association phase curve fitting” is used on SPR association phase data to obtain the constants Beq (binding at equilibrium) and kobs (observed     association rate constant). 
  
  •	The R script “Dissociation phase curve fitting” is used on SPR dissociation phase data to obtain the dissociation rate constants. 
  
  •	Beq and kobs values derived for a range of analyte concentrations are used to derive the KD, using the R scripts “Equilibrium analysis” and “kobs against con”.
